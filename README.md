👋 Howdy! I'm Alfin Prasetya, your friendly indie game programmer extraordinaire!

🎮 Whether it's crafting whimsical adventures or diving into the depths of retro nostalgia, I live and breathe for the magic of game development. You might've stumbled upon some of my wild and wacky creations over on [itch.io](https://fierceface.itch.io/)—trust me, they're a rollercoaster ride of fun!

🌟 Currently, I'm knee-deep in the vibrant world of Godot, tinkering with pixels and code to cook up the next big indie sensation. Oh, and speaking of sensations, I've got a knack for whipping up some seriously addictive Android games using React Native.

🕹️ But hey, it's not all about front-end fireworks! I'm also the wizard behind the curtain when it comes to backend sorcery. Restful APIs? Multiplayer marvels? You name it, I've probably dabbled in it, thanks to my trusty sidekicks Node.js and Spring.

🌱 Always hungry for new challenges and adventures, I'm on a never-ending quest for knowledge and creativity in this crazy, ever-evolving indie game universe.
